# Advent of Code 2021

Attempt at solving the [AoC21 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) using Elixir Livebook.

## Running locally
Copy (and customize?) the environment variables file: `cp .env.example .env`. Read more about possible values [here](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook#environment-variables).

The convenience script `./scripts/run.sh` will pull the latest Livebook image from Docker Hub and run it.
